    This Games Jam project was such a fun learning experience for me, while probably not being the most impressive project ever and likely not being on this portfolio
    for long I feel as though I learnt lots of things about game development and unity from it. I worked on this project solo and from home due to covid so I still intend
    to take part in other game jams to get the team experience. The list of things I learnt is pretty substantial considering it was my first proper time using unity.
    I learnt firstly how to create a unity project and export it as a game. The game was 2D so I learnt about unitys different camera modes as well as how to create a tile
    map for the background and specify tiles to have colliders. I used collision to allow the user to talk to characters, pick things up and be killed by the enemies.
    I learnt how to use unities sprite animation tools to create a walk cycle and I used audio with a plugin that allowed easy changing of tracks and resuming tracks at a certain point.
    
    The game is mainly a light puzzle game where the player has to find a way to progress through a building. picking up keys and other objects to allow interaction.
    One door puzzle where the player has to light 2 fires to progress I made use of unitys particle system to create the fire. And for another puzzle the user has to push
    an object around the scene into the correct area.
